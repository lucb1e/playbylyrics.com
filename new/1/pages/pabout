	<b>What is Play By Lyrics?</b><br />
	This site enables you to type in songtexts (or 'lyrics') from songs and automatically find the music video for it. You can <b>type in
	whatever you remember of the song, and it will find it!</b> If you know the artist or song title, adding this behind or before
	the lyrics usually enhances the results.<br />
	Some examples:<br />
	<a href='/?lyrics=when I ruled the world'>when I ruled the world</a><br />
	<a href='/?lyrics=Paint black heart'>Paint black heart</a><br />
	<a href='/?lyrics=loosing control come on rock everybody'>loosing control come on rock everybody</a><br />
	<br />
	Many people nowadays know how to do this manually with Google, but I thought this could be done better. This site:<br />
	<ul>
		<li>Is faster than doing it yourself;</li>
		<li>can try another result with just one click; and</li>
		<li>has some extra features like auto-replay or downloading the mp3.</li>
	</ul>

	I don't really expect anyone to want this, but I'd be very happily surprised! It would greatly help me to keep this
