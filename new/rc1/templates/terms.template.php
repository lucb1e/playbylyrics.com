	<b>Disclaimer</b><br />
	This service is brought to you for free and is powered by <a href="//www.google.com">Google</a> for core functionality,
	<a href="http://is.gd">is.gd</a> for URL shortening, <a href="http://grooveshark.com">Escape Media Group</a> and
	<a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> APIs for finding the song you are playing on Grooveshark and Last.fm. There is no warranty of any kind, etc.<br />
	The search is fully automated and in no way checked for any kind of material. Whatever you put in the search box decides what comes out. But Youtube
	is generally a safe website so I guess nothing that might hurt your innocence should appear.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Privacy</b><br />
	No cookies are used by this domain itself, only Statcounter is used to provide some statistics. Statcounter places a cookie to later determine whether
	you're a new or returning visitor. It may also be that the embedded Youtube video on this site sets a cookie for Google's own purposes or that Google
	logs something about you; I have no control over this behavior.<br />
	<br />
	For security reasons, all pages you load on this domain are logged. Your IP address, browser (user agent), and the requested page are stored
	together with a date and time. This data will be used solely to identify people who abuse the service and will never be shared with any
	third party. Of course I can't deny Dutch law enforcement, so that's the one exception here.<br />
	<br />
	These logfiles go back a couple of weeks. You can, by European law, request a copy of all log entries about you and request to remove this data.
	You must however be able to prove that the IP address in question is of was indeed yours, but we can discuss this when needed.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Terms of Service</b><br />
	You may use the service all you like and even embed it into your own site, but not intentionally try to disrupt or overload the service or any of the
	APIs that it uses (like the Last.fm API). I can revoke your access to this website whenever I want. Because I cannot smell whether you are doing a
	whitehat or blackhat hacking attempt, I recommend you simply don't try. I can hardly prohibit trying, but your ISP may get an abuse notification
	and I could (by Dutch law, under which you are operating when you communicate with this server) sue you.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>Copyright</b><br />
	This website has, of course, copyright under the Dutch Auteurswet.</br>
	Copying the idea and making your own version is not allowed either. If you want to integrate a similar service into an already existing product (such
	as Grooveshark or Spotify or something), please contact me. It's likely that I can give you the source code without fee simply for getting credits.<br />
	<br />
	Any music displayed on this website is probably not my poperty, nor provided by me. I don't even run ads, so there isn't really any reason to sue me
	over it without suing Youtube itself (they actually make money by displaying your music). Any ads that your video would display on Youtube will also be
	displayed here, so you can't say I'm withholding any revenue from anyone. You can try DMCA takedown notices, but I'm not USA-based so you might need to
	convince me they apply to me.<br />
