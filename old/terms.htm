			<h3>Legal &amp; privacy page</h3>
			<b>Disclaimer</b><br />
			This service is brought to you for free and is powered by <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> for core functionality,
			<a href="http://is.gd">is.gd</a> for URL shortening, <a href="http://grooveshark.com">Escape Media Group</a> and
			<a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> APIs for finding the song you are playing on Grooveshark and Last.fm. There is no warranty of any kind, etc.<br />
			The search is fully automated and in no way checked for any kind of material. Whatever you put in the search box decides what comes out. Furthermore,
			Youtube is generally a safe website so I guess nothing that might hurt your innocence should appear.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<b>Privacy</b><br />
			No cookies are used by this domain itself, only since July 8th 2012 Statcounter was added to provide decent statistics. Statcounter places a cookie to
			determine later whether you're a new or returning visitor. It may also be that the embedded Youtube video on this site sets a cookie for Google's own
			purpose or that Google logs something about you; I have no control over this behavior.<br />
			<br />
			For security reasons, all pages you load on this domain are logged. Your IP address, browser (user agent), and the requested page are stored
			together with a timestamp precise to one second. This data will be used solely to identify people who abuse the service and will <i>never</i> be
			shared with any third party.<br />
			<br />
			These logfiles roughly go back 6 weeks. You can, by European law, request a copy of all log entries about you and request to remove this data.
			You must however be able to prove that the IP address in question is indeed yours, for example by loading playbylyrics.com/yourcode and then asking
			me to look for 'yourcode'.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<b>Terms of Service</b><br />
			You may use the service all you like and even embed it into your own site, but not intentionally try to disrupt or overload the service or any of the
			APIs that it uses (like the Last.fm API). I can revoke your access anytime when I find that you abused the service.<br />
			<br />
			Because I cannot smell when you are doing a whitehat or blackhat hacking attempt, I recommend you simply don't try. There isn't much to try anyway,
			it's not like there is a user database or admin panel or so.<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<b>Copyright</b><br />
			Copying the idea and making your own version is not allowed when your version is not very significantly enhanced. The design does not matter in this case,
			only functionality is taken into account. When you claim your version predates mine, the current date is May 19th 2012 as you can see in the domain
			registration. If you indeed predate me, I will gladly link to your website given that yours works as easily or even better than mine.<br />
			<br />
			Any music displayed on this website is not my poperty, nor provided by me. I don't even run ads, so there isn't really any reason to sue me over it
			without suing Youtube itself (who does make music by displaying your music). Any ads displayed on Youtube will also be displayed here, so you can't say
			I'm withholding any money from anyone.<br />
